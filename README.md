# Covid-19 Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze and visualize Covid-19 data from 2020 to 2021, providing insights into the global impact of the pandemic. The project showcases my SQL querying skills and Tableau visualization abilities.

## Motivation

With the Covid-19 pandemic affecting the world in unprecedented ways, I was intrigued to delve into the data and understand the magnitude of its impact. This project allowed me to combine my passion for data analysis with a real-world scenario, contributing to the collective understanding of this global crisis.

## Data Sources

The Covid-19 data used in this project was obtained from _Our World in Data_ website. You can access the data by visiting https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. Before analysis, I performed necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## SQL Querying

To extract relevant information from the Covid-19 dataset, I executed several SQL queries. Leveraging the power of SQL, I utilized a table named _CovidDeaths2_ to retrieve specific columns and apply filtering conditions. These queries were instrumental in preparing the data for further analysis and visualization.

## Tableau Visualization

Using Tableau, I created visually appealing dashboards to present the insights gained from the Covid-19 data analysis. The visualizations include various charts, graphs, and maps that effectively communicate the global impact of the pandemic. They highlight key metrics, regional trends, and comparative analyses to provide a comprehensive view of the data.

## Project Findings

Through the analysis of the Covid-19 data, several noteworthy findings emerged. These include significant spikes in infection rates during specific time periods, variations in the impact across different countries and regions, and the correlation between preventative measures and the number of cases. The visualizations effectively showcase these findings, making complex data accessible and understandable.

## Usage Instructions

To see the Tableau visualizations, visit (https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidWorld2020-2021/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) and explore the various dashboards.

If you would like to replicate this analysis on your own dataset, refer to the sample SQL queries provided in the `queries.sql` file. Simply run these queries on your dataset, ensuring that the table names and columns align with your data schema.
